Ordered my Vibram Five Finger running shoes last night. I want to get back into barefoot running since it really made sure I was having good form. Will update soon.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Astro Blog** Working on images
2. **What I learned** Reading docs on getting images to work
3. **Exercise** Walked about 3 miles today and got about 11,300 steps
