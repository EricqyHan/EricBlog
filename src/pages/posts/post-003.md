Welcome to my _second post_ about learning Astro and getting back into programming!

## What I've accomplished

1. **Finished Setting Up Astro Blog**: I setup my astro blog today.

2. **What I learned**: Nothing yet. I have three hours before my shift starts. Working overnights is tough on the body, I was able to get almost six hours of sleep today. I woke up feeling under the weather.

3. **Exercise** Nothing today. I plan on getting a nice run tomorrow. I want to aim for four miles under 50 minutes. Let see how far I can run in 50 miles. Does Garmin have an API I can use on my blog? It be nice to also share my running journey with people.

## What's next

Let's see how much I can learn in the next three hours before my shift starts. It's 8:00 PM as I am writing this. It's going to be a fun night.
